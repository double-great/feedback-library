On [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/), you can find a **Were you able to find what you were looking for?** feature stuck to the right side of the page with the options `Yes, easily`, `Yes, eventually`, and `No`. You can also send optional comments.

When you select any option or submit comments, a confirmation appears:

![Thank you! Your feedback has been submitted.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-14-github-2.png)
