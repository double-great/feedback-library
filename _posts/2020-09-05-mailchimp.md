On [Mailchimp's Guides and Tutorials](https://mailchimp.com/help/), you can find a **Was this article helpful?** feature at the bottom of each page. You can select `Yes` or `No` and let them know if there's anything they can do to improve their site through a text area, which is optional. You must confirm that you are not a robot before submitting your feedback.

If you click yes, a group of checkboxes appears above the text area that asks you to tell them more about your experience. You can select from: `It was easy to find what I was looking for.`, `I could easily scan a help article to find the information I needed.`, `The help articles are easy to read.`, `The help articles helped me resolve my issue.`, `Mailchimp is easy to use.`, `I just love Mailchimp!` or `Other.`.

If you click no, a different group of checkboxes appears. You can select from: `The help articles don't make sense.`, `I wish there was a video that showed me how to do this.`, `What I'm trying to do in Mailchimp doesn't work the way I think it should.`, `It was hard to find what I was looking for.`, `I never found what I was looking for at all.`, `I have to contact Support to resolve my issue (for example, an account or billing problem).`, or `Other.`,

![Sorry we couldn't be more help. Can you tell us about your experience today?](/feedback-library/img/2020-09-05-mailchimp-3.png)

After you submit your feedback, a thank you message replaces the feedback form.
