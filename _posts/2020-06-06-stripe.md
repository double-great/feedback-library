[Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/) pages includes a "What this page helpful?" feature with a yes and no rating system:

![Was this page helpful? Yes No.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-stripe.png)

When you click either rating button, a confirmation appears:

![Thank you for helping improve Stripe's documentation.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-stripe-2.png)

This feature does not appear to work if you have an adblocker enabled.
