[Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/) has a "Was this document?" button stuck at the button-right of the page. You can select "Yes", "Yes, but...", and "No."

When you select "Yes" a confirmation appears to thank you for your feedback:

![Thank you for your feedback](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-facebook-2.png)

When you select "Yes, but...", a modal appears with several checkbox categories and a text area to send comments:

![How can we make the document more helpful?](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-facebook-3.png)

When you select "No", the same modal as the "Yes, but..." response appears but with slightly different leading text:

![What can we change to improve your experience?](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-facebook-4.png)

If you close the feedback feature, a "Give Feedback" button appears.
