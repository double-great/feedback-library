On the bottom of [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/) pages, you will find a **Helpful?** feature with the options `Yes` and `No`.

If you click `Yes`, an optional text area with a placeholder that asks you if there's anything else Apple should know appears. The section also asks that you do not include any personal information in your response.
