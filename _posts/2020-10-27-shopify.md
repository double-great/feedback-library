[Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/) has a **Was this page helpful?** feature on the bottom of each page with the options `Yes` or `No`.

![Was this page helpful?](/feedback-library/img/2020-10-27-shopify-1.png)

When you click `Yes`, a text area appears asking you, "What did you like about this page? (optional)."

After you submit your rating and optional text feedback, a thank you message replaces the text area. The rating buttons still appear, but they are disabled.

When you click `No`, a group of radio buttons appear with the following options: `This isn't what I was looking for.`, `There aren't enough examples.`, `The information is hard to understand.`, `The information doesn't solve my issue.`, `Other`. A text area also appears.

When you select an option, the placeholder text for the text area changes to help guide your response.
