If you click "Yes", a modal with a text area appears:
![Great! What did you like.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-segment-4.png)

If you click "No", a modal with a text area appears:

![Sorry to hear that. What can we do better.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-segment-5.png)

After you clicked either option, a link appears to allow you to send more feedback.
