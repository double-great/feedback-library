[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) has a "Was this doc helpful to you?" button stuck to the button-right of the page. As you scroll, the button comes with you. On smaller screens the button unhooks and sits at the bottom of the page.

When you click the "Was this doc helpful to you?" button, a modal appears with an emotion-based rating (😕 😐 🙂) and the option to add comments:
