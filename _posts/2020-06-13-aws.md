[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) has a **Did this page help you?** feature at the bottom of each page with the options `Yes` and `No`. You can also click direct links to **Provide feedback** or **Edit this page on GitHub**.

A **Feedback** link also appears at the top-right of the site's navigation which links to their external feedback form:

If you click `Yes`, a modal appears with confirmation of your rating and a link to their external feedback form:

![Thanks for letting us know we're doing a good job!](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-13-aws-2.png)

If you click `No`, the same confirmation modal appears but with a switch in tone:

![Thanks for letting us know this page needs work. We're sorry we let you down.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-13-aws-3.png)

The external feedback form asks:

- Kind of issue (`Kudos`, `Typo, grammar, or spelling issue`, `Broken link`, `Inaccurate content`, `Other`),
- How can we make the documentation better?
- What are you trying to do?
- Contact information (optional)
