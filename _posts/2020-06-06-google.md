[Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/) has a star rating option and a **Send Feedback** button at the top and bottom of each page. You can rate or submit feedback.

The feedback feature at the bottom of the page:

![Was this page helpful? ☆☆☆☆☆ Send feedback.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-6.png)

When you hover over each star, the rating describes itself as Unusable, Poor, Ok, Good, or Excellent.

![Good documentation ★★★★☆.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-4.png)

When you click the **Send Feedback** button, a modal appears to submit documentation feedback or product feedback:

![Send feedback about this page (documentation feedback) or Sheets API (product feedback).](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-2.png)

When you click documentation feedback, the modal allows you to build a screenshot to center on the problem area. You can also describe your feedback in the text area:

![Send feedback. Have feedback? We'd love to hear it, but please don't share sensitive information.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-3.png)

When you click product feedback, the link brings you to an external issue tracking site to submit your product feedback:
