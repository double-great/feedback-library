The feature at the bottom of the page:

![Was this page helpful? ☆☆☆☆☆ Send feedback.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-6.png)

When you hover over each star, each rating is assigned a title (Unusable, Poor, Ok, Good, Excellent):

![Good documentation ★★★★☆.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-4.png)

When you click the Send Feedback button, a modal appears to submit Documentation feedback of Product feedback:

![Send feedback about this page (documentation feedback) or Sheets API (product feedback).](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-2.png)

When you click documentation feedback, the modal create a screenshot for you to center the problem area and then describe your feedback in the text area:

![Send feedback. Have feedback? We'd love to hear it, but please don't share sensitive information.](/feedback-library/img/2020-06-06-google-3.png)

When you click product feedback, the link brings you to an external issue tracking site to submit your product feedback:
