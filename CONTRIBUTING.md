# Contributing

To add a new post:

1. Create a file in the `_posts/` directory, using `YYYY-MM-DD-[site-name].md` format.
2. The markdown file must have:
   - `title` - The title of the website or product.
   - `categories` - See `categories` [.remarkrc](.remarkrc) for available categories. This should be formatted as an array.
   - `image` - The image must be saved in `img/` folder and using the same filename pattern. The content of the image should be altered to remove extraneous content to focus solely on the feedback feature.
3. The content of the page should be brief description of where the feedback feature is on the page, types of options available, and a walk through the workflow. Include screenshots of different options and save these images in the `img` directory.
